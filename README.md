My first project on Java FX Swing

I create a scene that has a circle move to 4 points in sequence when we click on the left-click mouse
and move on reverse when we click on the right-click mouse

when we press the letter "a" the scene changes from automatic to manual

When the scene is manual the circle go the location clicked by the mouse

To test this application, download .jar and then run it.

My next task is to transfer this application to a "DLL" file so that it is useful and that you can use it in code.
