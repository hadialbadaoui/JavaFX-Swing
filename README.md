My first project on Java FX Swing

I create a scene that has a circle move to 4 points in sequence when we click on the left-click mouse button
and move on reverse when we click on the right-click mouse

When we press the letter "A" the scene changes from automatic to manual, and the number "0" changes the scene from manual to automatic

When the scene is manual, the circle goes to the location (x,y) of the mouse where it was clicked on the screen

To test this application, download the .jar and then run it.

You can give this screen any height and width. The circle moves on the screen without touching the border of the screen

My next task is to transfer this application to a "DLL" file so that it is useful and that you can use it in code.
